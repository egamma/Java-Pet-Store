<h1>Java Pet Store 2.0 Reference Application, Early Access</h1>





The Java Pet Store 2.0 Reference Application is a sample application
brought to
you by the <a href="http://blueprints.dev.java.net/">Java
BluePrints</a>
program at <a href="http://sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a>.
This application is designed to illustrate how the Java EE 5 Platform
can be used to develop an AJAX-enabled Web 2.0 application. The
application comes with full source-code available under a&nbsp;
BSD-style license, so you can experiment with it and use it in your own
applications. <br>


<br>


The Java Pet Store 2.0 is the reference application for building AJAX
web applications on Java EE 5. It illustrates BluePrints for using AJAX
with Java, building AJAX-enabled JSF component libraries, using Java
Persistence APIs, applying MVC and other design patterns in an AJAX web
app, using Mashups such as Google Maps service for location specific
searches of pets and PayPal service for purchases, using an RSS feed as
a data&nbsp; source, and lots more.<br>
