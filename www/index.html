<h1>Java Pet Store 2.0 Reference Application, Early Access</h1>
The Java Pet Store 2.0 Reference Application is a sample application
brought to
you by the <a href="http://blueprints.dev.java.net/">Java
BluePrints</a>
program at <a href="http://sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a>.
This application is designed to illustrate how the Java EE 5 Platform
can be used to develop an AJAX-enabled Web 2.0 application. The
application comes with full source-code available under a&nbsp;
BSD-style license, so you can experiment with it and use it in your own
applications. <br>
<br>
The Java Pet Store 2.0 is the reference application for building AJAX
web applications on Java EE 5. It illustrates BluePrints for using AJAX
with Java, building AJAX-enabled JSF component libraries, using Java
Persistence APIs, applying MVC and other design patterns in an AJAX web
app, using Mashups such as Google Maps service for location specific
searches of pets and PayPal service for purchases, using an RSS feed as
a data&nbsp; source, and lots more.<br>

<h2><a name="learn"></a>Learn More About
Features in Java Petstore</h2>
<p>Here are some of the features of this application:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Using AJAX for single-page interactive Web applications:
The
application is designed to be a single-page application where the user
never leaves the page. Different sections of the page are dynamically
loaded based on the user actions. These sections are loaded
asynchronously to avoid any browser refreshes, and to give a richer
interactive user-experience.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Mash-ups with Google maps: The petstore uses a mashup with
Google's Map service, alongwith Yahoo's Geo-coder service to allow
users to see the available pets in a neighborhood.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Community-created content: The application allows a user to
add a
pet for sale or adoption on the Website. The seller uploads&nbsp;</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Using Captchas to discourage spam in the community
created
content: Whenever a website allows its users to add content, it needs
to build mechanisms to discourage placement of spurious content on its
Website through automated mechanisms. We demonstrate how captchas can
be used for this purpose.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Community rated content: Each item in the petstore
website can be rated by the users&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Payments through PayPal: The application provides a
meeting ground for
buyers and sellers of pets. The application uses the PayPal service to
allow sellers to accept payments.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Integration of an RSS feed: The website integrates an RSS
feed of news items coming out the Java BluePrints website. The </li>
  <li>Integration of &nbsp;a search engine: The application
integrates Apache Lucene search engine to handle all website searches. </li>
</ol>
This application also demonstrate the use of various features
of&nbsp; the Java EE 5 platform such as: <br>
<ol>
  <li>JavaServer Faces: Many of the AJAX features are implemented
as reusable JavaServer Faces components.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Java Persistence API: The application uses Java Persistence
APIs to create an object/relational mapping layer.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Dependency Injection: The application uses dependency
injection instead of deployment descriptors.</li>
</ol>

Store Architecure document</a> for more detail. Also see the various
blogs and news under <a
 href="https://blueprints.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectNewsList">Java
BluePrints Announcements</a> on the petstore for some technical
insights. <br>
<h2><a name="netbeans"></a>Use the Java Pet Store in NetBeans</h2>
The Java Pet Store 2.0 is NetBeans-ready! Just open the petstore as a
project in <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">Netbeans</a>
and build and deploy it. Or if you think of feature you would like to
add to the Pet Store code? Use NetBeans Java EE 5 features and make a
better Java Pet Store. You can check out the <a
 href="../../blueprints/www/petstore/netbeans.html">Java Pet Store page
for NetBeans</a> users for more detail.
<h2><a name="contributors"></a>Show
Appreciation for Pet Store Image Contributors</h2>
<p>For many images in the Java Petstore, some organizations and
people were kind enough to give us permission to photograph their
animals or even give us photos to use in the Java Petstore. See the <a
 href="https://blueprints.dev.java.net/petstore/imagecontributors.html">
image contributors </a> page for a more detail on these friends
of the animals.&nbsp;
