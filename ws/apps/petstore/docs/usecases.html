<h2>Use Cases in Petstore 2.0</h2>
<br>
This document describes some of the features, functionalities, and use
cases shown in Petstore. We can add a more simple UML diagram later
also.<br>
now add some more <br>
This section will describe the use cases from users point of view. This
is modelling a Web 2.0 application, where we connect the buyer and
seller of pets and dont ourselves have inventory for sale. All the
goods for sale are offered by users. The users have the ability to add
content to the site, in terms of adding ratings of items for sale,
tagging to create some user taxonomy, etc.
We are not modelling a traditional web app use case, which would be a
web app version of a brick and mortar store. In the traditional type of
app, its use cases mirror what customers do in the store, browse the
aisles, put stuff in their cart, when doing shopping go to the counter
to purchase their stuff, enter ATM or credit card and hit submit. We
are not creating a web version of this brick and mortar business model.
<p>Note, there are two main user roles, one is for people who want to
buy a pet and another is for people who want to sell a pet. Also, if
pets are free, this can also be used to adopt a pet. Lets look at those
two broad users and the associated use cases
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Home Page
    <ol>
      <li>First there is a home page, displaying the petstore logo with fisheye
      </li>
      <li>directs users to selling or buying and other activities
      </li>
    </ol>

  </li>
  <li>Seller
    <ol>
      <li>Main use case is the ability to upload images and information to sell a pet, uses AJAX file upload
      </li>
      <li>AJAX Progress Bar to indicate file upload status
      </li>
      <li>Seller provides images for pet being sold
      </li>
      <li>Seller provides description, price, location, contact info for purchase, etc in web page
      </li>
      <li>Seller provides category info
      </li>
      <li>Later, may add abiltity to let seller choose a number of tags to associate with pet for sale
      </li>
      <li>Captcha required to avoid automated graffiti to site
      </li>
      <li>Supplier assigned unique page address for item being sold.
      </li>
      <li>Suppliers can update the item for sale at later time, including removal of SOLD items
      </li>
      <li>Later, may allow sellers to create an Identity, and have an associated account, to manage multiple items they might be selling.
      </li>
    </ol>

  </li>
  <li>Buyers
    <ol>
      <li>Browse pets for sale, when clicking a category will see ...
        <ol>
          <li>an accordian for category listings on left,
          </li>
          <li> a slider on bottom to allow continuous viewing of images from long list, showing all pets in a category for sale
          </li>
          <li> a bigger box in middle for details about a pet, default to firts pet in slider list
          </li>
          <li>we supply a default taxonomy for browsing by categories of animals
          </li>
        </ol>

      </li>
      <li>Search of pets using Lucene search in app. Keyword based search of our DB.
      </li>
      <li>Location-based Search for pets, using Google maps. So all the pets
will show up in balloons on google maps in our app, so shows mashup.
One of the "add ons" we may want to consider for the Map component is a
direction/distance service - maybe something that shows you
direction/distance to pet store locations from a starting location.
      </li>
      <li>buyer can see other user-tagged items page and browse tagged items, such as all dogs tagged as hot, for hot dogs
      </li>
      <li>buyer can tag items that are for sale, so that there is a user defined taxonomy for the site
      </li>
      <li>user can click check announcements for latest blueprints
announcement, which will read from our RSS feed on java.net, so will
show how to integrate RSS feed in mash up
      </li>
      <li>buyer can Rate items for sale. Can choose among 1 to 5 stars, so other users can share in the rating.
      </li>
      <li>buyer can make a purchase, which means they connect to a seller.
They are expected to buy one pet(not a shopping cart model). Initially,
sort of like Craigslist.
      </li>
      <li>allow purchase to be done using PayPal mashup
      </li>
      <li>Later, users can get alerts while they are browsing for pets when simultaneously a supplier enters a new item for sale</li>
    </ol>

  </li>
</ol>


Now lets look at the use cases on each page<br>
<ul>
