<h2>100 Design Choices and Tips we made when designing,
implementing,
refactoring the java petstore.
</h2>

<br>

Here are 100 design choices we made when making petstore. These are
brief and may refer to other docs for details. Lets capture briefly
those choices and elaborate later
<br>

<ol>

  <li>Use project conventions</li>

  <p>By choosing some conventions for directory structure of the
workspace
and building of the project you save a lot of team discussion time and
. Over time these conventions get better. <br>

--choosing conventions for packaging?? snce not everything is mandated
by packaging rules, some things are up to you to choose, like where to
store JS files? </p>

  <li>Pre-compile</li>

  <p>We use the pre-compile option</p>

  <li>Externalize app server environment properties</li>

  <p>The application code may need access to an environment
property, and
often this ends up in your code someowhere as a contsant or as a piece
of code using System property lookups. For deployment environment
properties that the code needs, use env-entires instead. </p>

  <li>Chose a exception flow handling convention</li>

  <p>We chose an exception handling design on client side for
Javascript, on web server tier, and on model tier. So that exceptions
flow though the system and we catch them when we can do something. We
use chaining to save information about original causes. See this [link]
doc for more details.</p>

  <li>Choosing Logging conventions</li>

  <p>Since logging will be used throughout you application its is
a good practice to choose a convention so that it is handled
consistently throughtout the application.</p>

  <li>Consider portability as an architectural issue</li>

  <p>To avoid being bound to any application server as much as
posisble. We externalized properties, mentioned above, we used standard
mechanism for icluding thrid-party libraries, etc.&nbsp;
You want to minimize dependencies of your application code from the
environment and factors such as the particular datbase, appserver, OS,
etc.&nbsp;
Use env entries, where to store image files in a portable location, how
to include third-party
jars, use Java Persistence Query language since it enhances portable
queries, and any others? </p>

  <li>Use an existing Javascript Ajax library</li>

  <p>Instead of reinventing all your own javscreipt and Ajax
code, we chose to leverage an existingWe chose to use DOJO tolkit</p>

  <li>Use Junit</li>

  <p>We used Junit for some unit testing.</p>

  <li>Chose a cnovention for our Constants files.</li>

  <p>We use a private constructor to avoid folks tinkering and
made public static final. See petstoreConstants.java for
example.&nbsp;</p>

  <li>Use Java SE 5 Features</li>

  <p>Java SE 5 has lots of feautres that are a godd practice to
adopt using them. For example, auto-boxing, Generics, and forloops etc.
  <a href="#Java_SE">See the section below</a>&nbsp;</p>

  <li>Choose Javascript Conventions</li>

  <p>Choose some conventions for Javascript object style etc so
that code works togethre on the same page and has some conssitency and
is easier to maintain.</p>

  <li>Choose a Java serverside web framework architecture</li>

  <p>There are many web app frameworks for Java apps. We chose to
use JSF as a web framework since it is standard. We chose to use a
hybrid of JSF and some of our own custom controller code so it is not
totally JSF-centric.</p>

  <li>Choose to move some functionality into a JSF library</li>

  <p>For som eof the PS funstionality we chose to wrap that
functionality into a set of JSF components an dthen use that library.</p>

  <li>Choose to use Java Persistence</li>

  <p>There are many persitence mechanisms for Java applications,
for example standard APIs such as JDBC and the new Java Persistence
APIs, as well as many frameworks. We chose to use Java Persistence APIs
for our domain model. It is standard on all Java EE 5 application
servers and provides a noce ORM mapping facility.</p>

  <li>Choose a web-only architecture</li>

  <p>Java EE 5 applications have many technologies to choose from
and many packaging options (ear files, war files, ejb-modules). We
chose to have a web-only architecture and not use any EJBs. We chose to
package the application as just a war file.</p>

  <li>Choose to cache application-scoped resources for re-use</li>

  <p>Since some resources in the application can be shared among
all
clients, its a good practice to hold onto them and resuse them for
subsequent requests. For example, the CatalogFacade was designed in a
thread safe manner so could be held for reuse. Resources such as
factories like UserTransaction and EntityManagerFactory are designed to
be thread-safe so can be re-used by multiple clients.</p>

  <li>Choose to cache some application-scoped data for re-ues</li>

  <p>Some data in PS was ame for all clients and could be shared
by the
application. For example the RSS news shown in th emnews bar and in the
news page was the same for all clients, Also this data didnt change a
lot so could be peridically refereshed to get any latest news. So we
were able to cache it in application-scope and re-sue it for other
cleinets, thus avoiding the need to go to the RSS feed on blueprints
for each cleint request and save some time.</p>

  <li>Choose to Validate at all tiers</li>

  <p>Its a good practice to validate onthe cleint side with
Javascript,
also onthe web tier, and on the model tier. Here is what we did.</p>

  <li>Choose to implement some patterns</li>

  <p>We followed MVC and used other patterns such as Vlaue List
Handler, Facade, etc in order to follow established best practices.</p>

  <li>put choice here
    <p>put explanation here </p>

  </li>

  <li>Chose to mark Session state as transient or make sure its
serializable??</li>

  <p>Make sure all class attributes/fields are maked as Transient
or Serializable. This will help support session failover features if
they are ever used.</p>

  <p>What about marking servlets as distributable??</p>

  <li>XHTML or HTML, and Doctype?</li>

  <p>put XHTML is the new standard for pages, but many authors
prefer HTML or XHTML-like-HTML(well form HTML). In addtion, HTML
doctypes can be strict or loose? What did we choose in petstpore and
why? Are we consistent.?</p>

  <p>Do we agree with <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://webkit.org/blog/?p=68">http://webkit.org/blog/?p=68</a>
or what, it basically says</p>

  <p>"On today's web, the best thing to do is to make your
document HTML4 all the way. Full XHTML processing is not an option, so
the best choice is to stick consistently with HTML4. Here's the best
way to do that:
  <br>

  <br>

&nbsp;1. Use an HTML4 doctype declaration <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://webkit.org/blog/?p=68">&lt;http://webkit.org/blog/?p=68&gt;</a>,
  <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ideally one that will trigger "standards
mode" in web browsers.
  <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One example of an HTML4 standards mode
doctype is |&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML
  <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01
Transitional//EN"
  <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"</a>&gt;|
  <br>

&nbsp;2. Serve your content with the <code class="moz-txt-verticalline"><span class="moz-txt-tag">|</span>text/html<span class="moz-txt-tag">|</span></code> MIME type,
or for local
  <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content give it a |.html| or |.htm|
suffix. This will lead
  <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; browsers, search engines, and other apps
to properly process your
  <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content as HTML.

  </p>

  <p>Mark, mentioned, For popup, had some problems. Be cognizant
of the effect different HTML Document Type Definitions (DOCTYPE) have
on your component.&nbsp; In the case of the Popup Balloon, we ran
into a problem when the http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd DOCTYPE
interfered with the positioning algorithm in certain browsers.</p>

  <li>Object Relational Maping Development style</li>

  <p>Chose not to do Java2DB, instead did mapping ourselves,
relied on default mappings most of the time.
Since we wrere creating tables and pojos from scratch we didnt have
legacy tables.<br>

use naming conventions
  </p>

  <li>Remove usage of deprecated methods</li>

  <p>put After building, check pront outs and remove all usage of
deprecated methods.</p>

  <li>Chose an absolute size for pages</li>

  <p>Absolute size, what size? 1024? Set banner to that size too?
We wanted the UI to have a consistent look even when users opened up
the browser in various sizes. &nbsp;</p>

  <li>Chose to use "target" for external links in the UI</li>

  <p>put The UI had a few links to external sites. These were in
the footer and the banner for example. Use "target" for footer links,
so pop up in new window. We decided to have same target id so all pop
up into same named window. If you use "_blank" instead of "petstore" as
id then each click pops into a new windo and opens a new window. For
RSS bar, choose target "RSS" so that all the clicks in it open into the
same window, so each announcement is in same windo instaed of a bunch
of pops ups. Choose ids and group clicks to avoid to many pop ups. We
didnt want the click of these links to replace the petstore app since
we wsanted users to saty in our PS site.</p>

  <li>Pull all strings out of Java code</li>

  <p>pull all strings out of Java code and other code? This is
useful in the future if we want to do I18N and L10N. Use resource
bundles, properties files one per package or in a central place. There
could be strings for presentation in the JSP pages. How many property
files, well in our case it was a small nmber of strings so we do just
one.<br>

For web pages we will use a common properties file petstore.properties
in the util/message.properties directory.<br>

For log files, same thing.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>What types of string mesages do we have? We had display
messages shown in the ui of the app on browser, log messages used by a
system admin, and there are also messages that come from the database
but we are not covering that in this choice, we are looking at getting
strings out of our code.</p>

  <li>Pull all strings out of Javascript?</li>

  <p>put explanation here</p>

  <li>remove all system.out.println and system.err.println?</li>

  <p>These are often used during development time to get a
specific printout. Before releasing we wanted to remove them or replace
them with usage of the logging utility instead.</p>

  <li>Chose to remove duplicate Javascript libraries, such as DOJO</li>

  <p>-what did we do since we needed multiple copies of dojo? The
PS had some pages that needed used DOJO.jar, plus we had a ui.jar that
included dojo.jar. Initially w eused both jar files, show snippet of
URL of PS page using dojo directly(the old way) then the new way with
shale remoting URL. The lesson here is: Reuse copies of DOJO instead of
bundling multiple copies. Be careful how many. If we were a live
application, deployed in the real world, our site would make dojo.jar
available to all our apps or re-use a lived deployed version like AOL,
but since we bundle we wanted our users to have a good experience.
Where is our DOJO Wher.jar for ui.jar,&nbsp; is PS dojo.jar</p>

  <li>Chose to use leverage autogenerated simple primary keys</li>

  <p>For primary keys we chose to use autogenerated IDs instead
of a key that was related to instrinsic values inthe data. Java
Persistence gives you a facility to generate unique keys. This adds an
extra field to your data tables and an extra filed to your Java
objects, but makes it very easy to manage keys.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>put explanation here</p>

  <li>put choice here
    <p>Using the new foreach constructs saves us from creating an
iterator and a regular for loop and is much easier to understand
because of fewer lines</p>

As you can see the petstore has a lot of design choices so maybe this
list can help you as a checklist on your own application<br>

<h1><a name="Java_SE"></a>Java SE 5 Conventions</h1>

here are some of the Java SE 5 conventions we chose to use
<ol>

  <li>Prefer using the new for loop</li>

  <p>Using the new foreach constructs saves us from creating an
iterator and a regular for loop and is much easier to understand
because of fewer lines. Here is an example of a refactoring to use new
for loop
  <table style="text-align: left; width: 901px; height: 300px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

    <tbody>

      <tr>

        <td>Code
Before</td>

        <td>Code After Using new for loop</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

        <td> <code></code><code>public void
someMethod()...<br>

{ <br>

...<br>

//processing a collection<br>

if ( ...) {<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Some iterator code here<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>

...</code></td>

        <td> <code><br>

public c</code><code>void someMethod()</code><code>
...<br>

        </code><code></code><code><br>

...<br>

//processing a collection<br>

if ()) {<br>

&nbsp; nice new for loop here</code><code style="font-weight: bold;"></code><code><br>

}<br>

        </code> </td>

      </tr>

    </tbody>
  </table>

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Code Example&nbsp;:
Refactoring to use new for loop from SE 5</span><br>

  <br>

  </p>

  <li>Prefer using Generics</li>

  <p>Generics are supported by the Java Psersistence APis so your
model tier can return a collection of generics, and you can use
generics all the way through your apps. For example, a web page showing
a list that was retireved from the DB can get a collection of generics
fromn DB and iterate through it.</p>

  <li>Used NIO Channels instead of input and output streams</li>

  <p>Channel has convenient methods (FileChannel.transferTo) to
copy an input stream into an output stream without requiring tedious
copying of reading and inputstream in a for loop in a buffer and
copying it to the output stream.</p>
