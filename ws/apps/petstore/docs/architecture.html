<h2>Petstore 2.0 Architecture</h2>
<br>
This document will outline some of the key choices made for the
petstore application, including exploration of various subsystems.<br>
<br>
<h3>Web application </h3>
We chose to make it a pure web application. This means that we did not use the 
EJB technology to create reusable components. The Web components directly 
accessed the objection relational layer built with Java Persistence.
<br>
<h3>Patterns to structure application</h3>
The petstore uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for 
overall structure. The controller is split in two: Web Controller and Ajax 
Controller.
<br>
The Web Controller keeps a mapping of client-requested URLs to action classes. 
It uses this mapping to invoke
<h3>Ajax UI</h3>
Used an Ajax UI so used Dojo and custom JS. Plus decided to create a set of JSF components.<br>
<br>
<h3>Page is the Application Architecture</h3>
How many pages, really just one?<br>
<br>
<h3>Security</h3>
security considerations were like any classic web app, plus had to deal
with JS security model, masup with other services, user uploaded content<br>
<br>
<h3>Mashups</h3>
Three styles of mashup were used in PS. Proxy, service delegation, and client library<br>
<h4>Proxy</h4>

<h4>Service Delegation</h4>

<h4>Client Library</h4>

<br>
<h3>Model Tier</h3>
Used Java Persistence APIs to build the model. Used JTA. Used Facade pattern to encapsulate.
