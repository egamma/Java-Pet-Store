<h2>Issue Tracker Policy For Developers of petstore Project</h2>
We use the issue tracker of the petstore at
https://petstore.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues<br>
<br>
Under the petstore component, there are 3 sub-components
<br>
<ol>
  <li>General,&nbsp; for most issues including RFEs</li>
  <li>download bundle, for the releases available to public on download
section of project<br>
  </li>
  <li>www for the online live docs&nbsp; published petstore website <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Creating a new Issue</h3>
Generally, when you create a new issue, just choose petstore
component and then choose one of the subcomponent categories. In the
drop down list for "Issue Type" there are choices such as&nbsp;
"Enhancement" for an RFE etc. That is all fairly obvious if you go to
the issuetracker.<br>
Lastly, and <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>importantly<span
 class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> when you fill in the "Summary" text
please preface the summary with something descriptive so that it makes
it easier to read the reports which
just list the summaries, please.
<a href="https://bpcatalog.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=39"></a><br>
<br>
In terms of RFEs, lets use the internal wiki to collect candidate use
cases and components. Otherwise we end up with too many scrathpad ideas
added in issuetracker. For enhancements/ RFEs of existing entries
<br>
<h3>Viewing a Report</h3>
