<h2>README For Developers of petstore Project</h2>



This doc will explain how to build the various builds of the bpcatalog
project, including the<br>



<ul>



  <li><a href="#project_apps">Building the petstore
application</a><br>



  </li>



  <li><a href="#building-viewer-distribution">Building the
distribution bundle</a>, which is
made available for
download</li>



  

</ul>



These instructions are useful for the developers on this project or
anyone else that would like to check out the cvs and build the project
and play around. This is just another way to use this project, in
addition to downloading the zip file, some folks may want to
build their own dist from the latest versions for things. <br>



This is also useful for new developers on the team.<br>
